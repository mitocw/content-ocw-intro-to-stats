Welcome to intro to stats.  In this course you will get a basic background into the process of collecting data and displaying data.  You will learn how to collect data, various methods of displaying data, and have the ability to use technology to create your plots. Throughout the course you will have a number of assignments to complete.  Some you will be able to send to me electronically, others will have to be turned in to me.  You will also be required to use a number of different forms of technology, as well as being required to describe your processes in paragraph form.  It is very important that you are able to describe your processes in a way so that someone who knows little or no statistics would understand.  I hope you enjoy this course and once completed decide to dive further into the world of statistics.
