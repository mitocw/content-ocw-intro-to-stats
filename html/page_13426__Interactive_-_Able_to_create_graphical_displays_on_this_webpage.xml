<html display_name="Interactive - Able to create graphical displays on this webpage">
This <a href="http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/" target="_blank">website</a> will allow you to create your own graphical displays.  This will be helpful in the histogram, stemplot, and boxplot sections.  If you use this site, you will need to click on activities, click on statistics, and find the activity you would like to use.  Each provides a quick explanation of how to use.  You may then use Jing to capture your display and send to me.
