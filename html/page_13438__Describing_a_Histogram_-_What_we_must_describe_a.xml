<html display_name="Describing a Histogram - What we must describe and other details that may help us describe our histogram">
  <body><p>When we describe a histogram, there are many things that we can talk about.&#160; The most important though are:</p>
<p>1. Shape:&#160; Is the distribution symmetric, skewed (tail on one side and that is the direction that the distribution is skewed to), or neither.</p>
<p>2. Center:&#160; Where is the middle?&#160; You can talk about the mean or median since both are measures of center, but the median is much easier to find in a histogram by looking for the middle observation.</p>
<p>3.&#160; Spread:&#160; Does the data cover a large or small range of values?&#160; Many times this is not as important unless you are comparing histograms (the spread of the male scores is larger than the female scores)</p>
<p>Other things to note when describing a histogram you could use are:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>gaps, outliers (extreme values), peaks (mode - observations that happen the most often), and min/max.</p>
