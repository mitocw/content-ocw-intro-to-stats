    <p>
This <a href="http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/" target="_blank">website</a>&#160;will allow you to create your own graphical displays.&#160; This will be helpful in the histogram, stemplot, and boxplot sections.&#160; If you use this site, you will need to click on activities, click on statistics, and find the activity you would like to use.&#160; Each provides a quick explanation of how to use.&#160; You may then use Jing to capture your display and send to me.
