<p>In this section we will look at how to determine if any of our observations are outliers.&#160; Outliers can affect many of our measures, but primarily our mean.&#160; If there is an outlier, our mean gets pulled towards it.&#160; For example, if a basketball player averages 8 points per game and scores 30 points in a game, his new average will rise considerably due to the outlying value.</p>
