<p>Standard deviation shows the variation or spread of a set of data.&#160; For a single set of data it may not show us a whole lot.&#160; It is very useful though in comparing sets of data.&#160; Such as a comparison of test scores of males versus females.&#160; We can tell which group has scores that are more spread out and then explore why one groups scores varied more than the others.</p>
